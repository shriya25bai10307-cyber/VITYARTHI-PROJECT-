# Meditation App – Project Statement

## Problem Statement
In today’s fast-paced and stressful world, people often struggle to find time and resources for relaxation, meditation, and mental well-being. Many existing meditation solutions are either subscription-based, complex, or require internet connectivity. There is a need for a simple, offline, and easy-to-use tool that allows users to engage in calming meditation sessions with optional background sounds.

## Scope of the Project
The meditation app provides users with a desktop-based solution to relax and meditate. Users can choose from multiple meditation sessions and play soothing background sounds such as ocean waves. The application is lightweight, requires minimal setup, and is designed to work offline, primarily on Windows systems. Future expansions may include timers, progress tracking, and additional sound options.

## Target Users
- Individuals looking to manage stress and anxiety
- People interested in guided meditation or mindfulness
- Students, professionals, and anyone seeking relaxation
- Users who prefer offline, lightweight applications

## High-Level Features
1. **Meditation Audio Playback** – Users can play preloaded meditation audio files (`med1.wav`, `med2.wav`).
2. **Background Sound** – Users can enable calming background sounds, such as ocean waves, to enhance the meditation experience.
3. **Start/Stop Controls** – Users can independently start and stop meditation audio and background sound.
4. **Simple GUI** – Built with Tkinter, providing a clean, easy-to-use interface.
5. **Offline Operation** – Works without internet connectivity.
6. **Expandable** – Designed to allow future features such as timers, session tracking, and additional sound options.
